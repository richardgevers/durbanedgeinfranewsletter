* To accelerate the completion of new infrastructure projects and maintain current infrastructure, it is necessary to package infrastructure funding requirements for all unfunded projects in an effort to secure external funding. This is a crucial factor in increasing the City’s revenue collection.

This may serve as the solution to several problems that project managers have identified (See Section 4 for full discussion)
