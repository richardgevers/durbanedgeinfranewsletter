# Should the EThekwini Municipality Consider Outside Funding Sources?

This section looks at the performance of historical capital expenditure in order to explore whether the City needs to consider outside funding sources. EThekwini Municipality’s expenditure accounts for about 1.0% of Durban’s GDP in 2021/22.&#x20;

The Municipality spent **R41.7 billion between 2015/16 and 2021/22** on capital expenditures. However, this was R8.5 billion short of its planned capital budget of R50.2 billion in the same period, mainly because of a lack of implementation and the repurposing of budgets. Over the medium term, the City’s capital expenditure has been on a steep decline, dropping by **45.1%** in real terms between 2015/16 to 2021/22. Between 2015/16 to 2020/21, it dropped by **15.2%**, meaning the majority of the decline was experienced in the 2021/22 financial year. The primary cause of the decline in capital spending in the eThekwini Municipality and other municipalities is that they underspent on conditional grants and are not generating enough revenue to cover their capital budgets.&#x20;

The capital budget is **R4.9 billion for the 2022–2023 fiscal year, followed by R5.1 billion in 2023–2024 and R5.2 billion in 2024–2025**.&#x20;

Over the MTREF period, the capital budget increased from R4.8 billion to R5.1 billion. **Grant funding (66.9%), loans (20.4%)**, and internally generated funds make up the three sources of funding for the 2022–23 budget **(12.7%)**.

The City’s borrowing levels have steadily decreased in both real and relative terms, reaching **R7.4 billion or 1.9 percent** of local GDP in 2021. The growth in revenue is attributed to a rise in property value and service fees rather than a rise in the number of customers. The main factors influencing total capital expenditure from 2015/16 to 2021/22 were housing accounted for **R11.6 billion (27%)**, water, waste and sanitation, which account for **R8.7 billion (20%)**, roads and transport accounted for **R6.1 billion (14%)**, electricity accounts for **R5.1 billion (12%)**, engineering accounts for **R4.98 billion (11%)**, Other services account for **R4.98 billion (11%)**, and finally, economic development services account for **R1.9 billion (4%)**. What is clear is that at the current pace of repairs and budgeting, the City is likely to start experiencing disinvestment over the medium-term, unless serious interventions are made, in capital interventions to address the failing infrastructure repairs and upgrades.
