# Interviews with Capital Project Managers

Capital project managers from eThekwini Municipality’s Economic Development Unit were contacted for the interviews in order to further shed light on the discrepancies between intended and actual capital expenditures and to pinpoint problems that contributed to the discrepancy and declining trend. Those interviewed were selected due to their direct and daily implementation of the City’s capital budget.

* **Innovation** in the current functional structure **is not applauded nor supported** by the systems
