# Introduction

The primary responsibility of local government is to make sure that any money collected through service fees is used for the provision of service delivery. This is how public funds are generated, which are then used to fund infrastructure upgrades and provide services to citizens and businesses. Furthermore, it can boost total revenue collection if done so with strong governance and financial investment (Titus 2013, Sewchurran and Davidson, 2021). Infrastructure development is a crucial engine for boosting economic activity. The report’s first section compares Durban’s capital spending to those of the main cities in South Africa. It also examines Durban’s capital expenditure and revenue collection performance, including the impact of capital expenditure on Durban’s economy, and it presents the data collected from project managers’ interviews. The last section investigates the relationship between capital expenditure and revenue generation. The key questions that the paper seeks to investigate are:

1. What is the impact of infrastructure investment on total revenue collection? Or are we really improving City’s revenue collection by investing in public infrastructure?
2. What is the capital budget threshold for eThekwini Municipality in comparison to other cities?
3. Given the two questions above, how should eThekwini be responding to its current infrastructure crisis?
