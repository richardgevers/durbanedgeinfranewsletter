# Summarised Results of the Vector Auto-Regression Model Analysis

The vector autoregression (VAR) model is adopted to investigate the relationship between eThekwini’s infrastructure spending and revenue collected. The monthly data is ultilised from 2015M1 to 2021M12, and it is sourced from eThekwini Municipality’s Expenditure Unit, 2022. This will provide an answer to this study’s main research question: “are we really improving City’s revenue collection by investing in public infrastructure?”

We discover that there is a positive relationship between capital expenditure and revenue collection. As a result, for every 1% increase in CAPEX, 0.1% more revenue is collected after infrastructure repairs/upgrades. This only applies in the short run, so an increase of 1% in CAPEX will only temporarily raise revenue by 1%, implying that the increase will not be sustained indefinitely. The City must ensure that CAPEX routinely rises in the short term to maintain revenue growth. A regular short-term expenditure on infrastructure repairs and upgrades will be necessary as a practical method of maintaining a rise in revenue. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a solution that will enhance the City’s spending culture and close the R8.5 billion difference between the planned budget and actual expenditure.

The operational expenditure in the model has a positive impact on the revenue collection. As the operational expenditure increases by 1%, the City’s revenue collection increases by 0.2% on average.&#x20;

**This illustrates that the more eThekwini Municipality allocates its resources to essential activities, such as internal system automation, improving competitiveness, and making it easier for businesses to operate, these indirectly have a favourable impact on revenue collection.**
